# private-repo
A repo based on Galladeguy's Downlow homebrew repo.
This alternate repository will contain homebrew I use regularly and, homebrew developed by yours truly.
For now it's going to contain most if not all of what's found at GalladeGuy's Downlow repo(https://github.com/GalladeGuy/Downlow).
This is NOT ment to replace his repo.
This is for private use only.(hence the name!)

#How do I get my homebrew on here?
Its pretty simple actually. Make a fork of this repo, go into the repos folder and go into the folder with your name (or create one if there isn't one already), and add in the nessecary files for the repo. I have a dedicated example homebrew repo you can find in the repo list folder. Don't foget to add your homebrew to the repolist.txt! Once you're done, just make a pull request! And if you don't know how to do that, well, maybe you should google it. I almost always accept, unless it is porn, graphic, completely pointless, or a screamer. Kids use this stuff you know! So go out there and make some homebrew!
